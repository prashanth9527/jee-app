## 📋 Title Generation Rules

The system automatically generates titles based on your selected questions:

| Question Metadata | Generated Title |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| All from "Newton's Laws" (subtopic) | `"Newton's Laws - Practice Exam"` |
| All from "Mechanics" (topic) | `"Mechanics - Practice Exam"` |
| All from "Thermodynamics" (lesson) | `"Thermodynamics - Practice Exam"` |
| All from "Physics" (subject) | `"Physics - Practice Exam"` |
| Mixed: Physics + Chemistry | `"Physics, Chemistry - Mixed Practice Exam"` |
| No metadata | `"Practice Exam - Jan 10, 2025"` |

## ⏱️ Time Limit Calculation

**Default Formula:** `2 minutes × number of questions`

**Examples:**
- 5 questions → 10 minutes
- 10 questions → 20 minutes
- 30 questions → 60 minutes
- 90 questions → 180 minutes (3 hours)

**Adjust based on:**
- Question difficulty (harder = more time)
- Student level (beginners need more time)
- Exam purpose (practice vs. mock test)
